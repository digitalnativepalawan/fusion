# FusionClaw

### All hustle. No luck. One database.

**The business-data layer for an agent runtime.** Your agent already runs your machine; this is how it reads and writes your business — customers, jobs, invoices, expenses and notes — over MCP, on one Postgres you own. Per-agent scoped keys, a confirmation gate on anything destructive, rate limits, and an audit log of every call it made.

## What is FusionClaw?

FusionClaw is a unified business platform built for small business owners and agencies who want one tool instead of ten. It merges CRM, employee ops, content creation, marketing, and bookkeeping into a single Next.js application — and exposes everything through MCP so AI agents like Claude Code can run your business alongside you.

### What sets it apart — agent-native from the metal up

Most CRMs added a chat sidebar. FusionClaw is built around a self-improving agent fleet:

- **🪄 Skill Forge** — Type a one-line goal, get a working skill (prompt + eval criteria + seed test cases) in 5 seconds
- **🧠 Karpathy reflection loop** — Every Monday at 6am the worst-performing skill gets analyzed and 3 prompt edits proposed
- **⚡ Reasoning trace streaming** — Watch agents think live; tool calls render as expandable nodes, final output as interactive UI
- **🎨 Generative UI** — Skills return scorecards, email previews, intel cards — not walls of text
- **🧪 Eval Studio** — Per-skill test cases with pass/fail matrix; 80% rate gates promotion to production
- **👥 Council mode** — 3 agents (Sales, Researcher, Closer) debate every deal, then synthesize a verdict
- **🎙️ Voice agent** — Full-duplex via OpenAI Realtime; talk to your CRM, run skills, create tasks
- **🌐 Browser-using skills** — Hand a URL, get back structured intel; ready to swap to Stagehand for full automation
- **💰 Cost-optimized routing** — Thompson sampling bandit picks the cheapest model that hits your eval bar
- **📚 Wiki memory** — The agent's memory layer is a transparent wiki you can read, edit, and curate (no opaque vector DB)
- **🛒 Skill Marketplace** — One-click install of curated templates with seed evals included

### Standard business capabilities

- **CRM & Pipeline** — virtualised lead table that stays responsive on large imports, full inline editing, drag-and-drop kanban, complete lead lifecycle
- **Employee Ops** — Shift tracking, daily checklists, task management, accountability reports
- **Content Studio** — OpenRouter streaming chat, fal.ai image generation, WordPress publishing
- **Marketing** — Email campaigns, AI content queue with approval workflow, content calendar
- **Finance** — Invoices with line items, expense tracking (10 categories), P&L dashboard with tax estimates
- **MCP Server** — 100+ tools exposing the entire platform to MCP-compatible agents with a single API key
- **Webhooks · Workflows · Activity Stream** — Inbound webhooks fire skills; outbound webhooks fire on lead/task/skill events; live activity stream shows every run + cost + latency

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Fusion-Data-Company/FusionClaw.git
cd FusionClaw
npm install
npm run onboard    # interactive: DB URL, optional API keys, MCP key, optional OWNER_PASSWORD
npm run dev        # http://localhost:3000 — no login required on localhost
```

**What you should see:** the landing page at `localhost:3000`. Click **Live Demo** → you're routed straight into the app at `/dashboard`. **No signup, no Clerk, no third-party auth.** On localhost you're trusted automatically. When you deploy to Vercel or your own server, you set a single `OWNER_PASSWORD` env var to gate the UI. Agents authenticate with the MCP API key.

> The `onboard` command creates your `.env.local`, pushes the database schema, generates a secure MCP API key, and optionally generates an `OWNER_PASSWORD` for deployed instances. Full docs at **[docs/](docs/index.md)** — setup, install paths, concepts, MCP reference, modules, security, troubleshooting.

## Modules

| Module        | Pages                                                       | Description                                                 |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Command**   | Dashboard, Today, Tasks, Employees, Reports                 | Daily operations hub with shift tracking and accountability |
| **Finance**   | Invoices, Expenses, Financials                              | Bookkeeping with P&L charts, tax estimates, overdue alerts  |
| **Contacts**  | Leads Database, Pipeline                                    | CRM with a virtualised lead table and a kanban pipeline     |
| **Marketing** | Campaigns, AI Queue, Studio, Gallery, Publishing            | Content creation and distribution pipeline                  |
| **System**    | Knowledge Base, Chat, Agents, Cron Jobs, Branding, Settings | AI assistant, automation, and platform configuration        |

## MCP server — `fusionclaw-mcp`

276 tools over 31 tables, published to npm. Install is one line and the config
is whatever your runtime already uses. Full documentation, scope grammar and
the Hermes / OpenClaw / Claude Code configs are in
[`mcp-server/README.md`](mcp-server/README.md).

```bash
npm install && npm run mcp:build          # until the package is on npm
node mcp-server/dist/index.js keygen --name my-agent --scopes "read:*"
node mcp-server/dist/index.js doctor
```

The package is publish-ready (`bin`, `files`, `engines`, `prepublishOnly`) but
**not published yet**, so `npx -y fusionclaw-mcp` does not resolve today. Every
config snippet shows both spellings.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "fusionclaw": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/FusionClaw/mcp-server/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "DATABASE_URL": "postgres://…",
        "FUSIONCLAW_MCP_KEY": "fcw_sk_…"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Every call passes the same gate: authenticate, scope, rate limit, confirm, run,
audit. A key only sees the tools it may run — a read-only agent is handed 77
tools, not 276.

| Category    | Tools | Real names |
| ----------- | ----- | ---------- |
| CRUD        | 248   | `db_leads_list`, `db_invoices_create`, `db_expenses_bulk_create`, `db_wikiPages_update` |
| Query       | 4     | `query_raw_sql` (SELECT only), `query_aggregate` |
| Analytics   | 7     | `analytics_dashboard`, `analytics_leads_pipeline`, `analytics_leads_forecast` |
| AI          | 5     | `ai_chat`, `ai_analyze_data`, `ai_humanize` |
| System      | 10    | `system_schema_info`, `system_db_health`, `system_cron_list` |
| Meta        | 2     | `fusionclaw_whoami`, `fusionclaw_audit_tail` |

Earlier versions of this table listed `leads_list`, `invoices_create` and
`expenses_delete`. Two of those names never existed and the other was wrong;
invoices and expenses were not exposed over MCP at all until v2.
